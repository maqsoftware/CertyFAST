# CertyFAST: Uncover Hidden Insights in Your Power BI Reports
CertyFAST empowers you to go beyond surface-level analysis in your Power BI reports. Here's what it offers:

- **Uncover Potential Issues**: CertyFAST automatically scans your report against your organization's defined standards. This helps identify areas that might bloat file size, slow down performance, or create a confusing experience for end users.

- **Trace Data Lineage**: Ever wondered how a specific data point is calculated? Lineage lets you visualize the chain of transformations, from raw data tables to the final visualizations. This helps you understand how changes in one part of the report might impact others.

- **Ensure Visual Harmony**: Inconsistent formatting or misaligned visuals can create a cluttered and confusing experience. Alignment helps you identify these issues, ensuring your report presents a clean and professional look.

- **Simplify Documentation**: Generating clear and consistent documentation can be time-consuming. CertyFAST automatically generates detailed documentation of your report's semantic model and visuals. This empowers developers to create knowledge documents quickly and efficiently.

- **Flexible Export Options**: Need to share insights or documentation with colleagues? CertyFAST allows you to export all relevant information about your report's semantic model and visuals in a user-friendly format, such as Excel or PDF.

By leveraging these features, CertyFAST transforms your Power BI analysis, helping you create high-quality reports that are informative, efficient, and user-friendly.

# Get Started Analyzing Your Power BI Reports
This guide will walk you through connecting to your Power BI reports for in-depth analysis.

- **Connecting to Your Report** - There are two ways to connect to your report, each focusing on a different aspect:
   1. Semantic Model: This option delves into the report's underlying data. You can explore tables, columns, measures, and how they relate to each other. Connect to already opened reports on your machine or upload the .bim file containing the data model.
   2. Report UI: This option focuses on how your data is presented visually, like charts and report pages. You can connect by uploading the complete .pbix report file or just the .json file containing the report layout.

- **Choosing Your Connection**
   1. Model Analysis: For a more thorough analysis with features like compliance check for your model structure, DAX best practices, and data lineage (tracing origin of measures) choose the Semantic Model connection.
   2. Visual Analysis: If you primarily want to analyze the report's visualizations and alignment, choose the Report UI connection.

    **Recommendation** - For the most comprehensive analysis, we recommend providing references for both the Semantic Model and Report UI (.pbix or .json file). This unlocks all available features to its true potential.

- **Starting Your Analysis**
   1. Once you have your connection references (file paths or uploaded files), proceed to the next step.
   2. Click the "Start Analysis" button. This will redirect you to a dedicated insights pane.

By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to extracting valuable insights from your Power BI reports!
